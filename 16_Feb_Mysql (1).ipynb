    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A database is an organized collection of data that is stored in a computer or a server. It is designed to store and manage large amounts of information that can be accessed, updated, and managed easily and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Databases are used to organize information into tables, columns, and rows, and they can be used to store different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, images, and other multimedia content. They are commonly used to manage information in various applications, including websites, online stores, financial systems, inventory systems, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Databases are essential for businesses and organizations that need to store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data. They provide a reliable and secure way to store and access data, and they can be used to create reports, run analyses, and perform other important functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL and NoSQL are two types of database management systems that differ in their structure, query language, and usage. Here are the key differences between the two:\n",
    "#### 1.Structure: SQL databases use a relational structure, meaning that data is organized into tables with defined columns and rows. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a non-relational structure, which means that data can be stored in a variety of ways, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-family, or graph databases.\n",
    "#### 2.Query Language: SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform queries, which is a standardized language for relational databases. NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, depending on the type of database, such as MongoDB's query language for document-oriented databases, or Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for column-family databases.\n",
    "#### 3.Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable, meaning that they can easily handle large amounts of data and high traffic. SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning that they can handle more data by increasing the capacity of a single server.\n",
    "#### 4.Flexibility: NoSQL databases are more flexible than SQL databases, as they do not have a fixed schema and can adapt to changes in the data model. SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning that changes to the database structure can be complex and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary, SQL databases are best suited for applications with a structured and well-defined data model, whereas NoSQL databases are better for applications that require flexible and scalable data management."

    "# Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define the structure of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, constraints, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some common DDL commands include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.CREATE: used to create a new database object such as a table, index, or view.  For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table named \"students\" with three columns:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE if not exists students (roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY , student_name VARCHAR(40) , class INT);\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object such as adding or dropping a column from a table. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column named \"student_age\" to the \"students\" table:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE students ADD student_age INT;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.DROP: The DROP command is used to delete an existing database object. For example, the following SQL statement drops the \"students\" table:\n",
    "DROP TABLE students;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all data from a table without deleting the table itself. For example, the following SQL statement removes all data from the \"students\" table:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE students;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.RENAME: RENAME command is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command used to rename an existing database object such as a table or column.\n",
    "RENAME TABLE students TO pupils; # rename the \"students\" table to \"pupils\"\n",
    "ALTER TABLE pupils RENAME COLUMN student_name TO pupil_name; # rename the \"student_name\" column to \"pupil_name\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DDL commands are important for database administrators and developers to understand, as they provide the means to define and manage the structure of a database. By using DDL commands, database objects can be created, modified, and deleted in a controlled and structured way, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the database.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### DML commands can be used to manipulate data in a variety of ways, including filtering, sorting, and grouping data, as well as performing calculations and aggregations. DML is an essential tool for managing and maintaining the data stored in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.INSERT: The INSERT command is used to add new data into a database. For example, if we have a table called \"students\" with columns for \"student_name\" and \"student_age\", we can use the following SQL statement to add a new student to the table:\n",
    "INSERT INTO students (student_name , student_age) VALUES ('nimish' , 22);\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a database. For example, if we want to update the age of the student we just added to the \"students\" table, we can use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "UPDATE students SET student_age = 23 WHERE student_name = 'nimish';\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.DELETE: The DELETE command is used to remove data from a database. For example, if we want to delete the student_name we just added from the \"students\" table, we can use the following SQL statement:\n",

    "#### DQL stands for Data Query Language. DQL is a key component of SQL (Structured Query Language), which is the most commonly used database language. SQL DQL commands are used to query and retrieve data from a database. For example, an SQL SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database based on certain conditions. DQL is used to query and extract data from a database.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The SELECT command is used to retrieve all the columns and rows of data from the \"students\" table in the database where the \"student_age\" column is greater than 18. The asterisk (*) is used to select all columns, but it is also possible to specify specific columns to be selected by listing them after the SELECT command, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The WHERE clause in this example is used to specify the condition that the \"student_age\" column must be greater than 18. This is just one of many conditions that can be used in the WHERE clause. Other conditions include equal to (=), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and so on.\n",

    "# Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In relational databases, a primary key and a foreign key are two important concepts that are used to define and enforce relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each row in the table is unique. A primary key cannot be null (empty), and each value in the primary key must be unique. A table can have only one primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, consider a table named \"customers\" that has columns for \"customer_id\", \"name\", and \"email\". In this case, the \"customer_id\" column could be designated as the primary key, as it is unique to each row and is used to identify each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key is used to establish a relationship between two tables, where the foreign key column in one table references the primary key column in another table. This allows for data to be linked between tables and for data to be accessed and updated in a consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, consider a second table named \"orders\" that has columns for \"order_id\", \"customer_id\", and \"order_date\". In this case, the \"customer_id\" column in the \"orders\" table could be designated as a foreign key, referencing the \"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table. This would establish a relationship between the two tables, such that each order is associated with a particular customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When a foreign key is defined, it is usually set up with a constraint that enforces referential integrity. This means that the foreign key value in one table must exist as a primary key value in another table. If the referential integrity is violated, the database will generate an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary, a primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, while a foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables."
